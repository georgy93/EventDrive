Create 2 applications, use rabbit mq to communicate :

1) Webapi – add two endpoints:
o AddItemsToRedis – adds list of custom type items to redis stream
o ItemsAdded – notify worker app through rabbit mq

2) Worker app – when notification for new items is receive, read items from redis stream and insert
them into MSSql database (use bulk operations)

Use Tye to start webapi and worker apps. https://github.com/dotnet/tye/blob/main/docs/tutorials/hello-tye/00_run_locally.md

Code should compile without errors.

Include readme how to start application and short description of the implementation.
Create public repo.

Bonus: Inslude unit tests.
